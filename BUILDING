This project was developed and tested in Spring Tool Suite 3.2.0.
A standard Eclipse Juno install with STS installed as a plug-in would likely
work as well, but YMMV.

To build in Eclipse you'll need to install the JiBX m2e connector and JiBX
Feature from the update site at http://jibx.sourceforge.net/eclipse/.  At the
time of this writing the version in use is 1.2.5, but see pom.xml as the
definitive source of truth.

Installation should be all that's needed, but see the following
for more details related to install and configuration:
